A Python application for solving Sudoku. 

The solver can solve Sudoku games ranging from easy to what is claimed to be the hardest Sudoku puzzle invented. The solver uses standard Sudoku logic to solve all but the hardest games. For the hardest games and having exhausted standard logic, 
the solver maintains a stack of exploratory moves to attempt to solve the game.
